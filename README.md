# Beck's Junkdrawer

This project is a collection of python scripts I use a lot. I've refactored many with ChatGPT to make it more clear what they do.

Please note that this codebase if written with macOS usage in mind. Some functions won't work on other operating systems.

## Install
To install this codebase, run this script. It will clone the code you need into `junkdrawer/` and get rid of anything else.
```zsh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beck1888/junkdrawer/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.zsh | zsh
```

You may also want to install the `requirements.txt` file. Alternatively, you can look at the source for just the files you want and just install those requirements. Please note that the install script removes any files that aren't `.py` or `.zsh` so the requirements file is only viewable on GitHub.
